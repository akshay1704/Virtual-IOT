(Try to) boot with:
qemu-system-i386 -machine pc -cpu coreduo -m 1G -drive file=image.qcow2 -device e1000,netdev=net -netdev user,id=net,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22 -kernel kernel -initrd initrd -nographic -append "root=LABEL=rootfs console=ttyS0"
You can use Ctrl-a x to exit from QEMU.
You can login with root:root or debian:debian, or using the identities ssh_user_*_key in this directory.
You can also login with SSH on the local port 2222 (this will give you a much better terminal emulation than the QEMU default).
Some machines support a video interface, which you can enable removing the -nographic option and possibly also the console= kernel argument.
